# Buzzer Service

**Host an online Buzzing System for online party games.**

An online buzzing system for your browser implemented in KTor / Kotlin using websockets.

This service provides a buzzing system with different lobbies with unlimited participants to join and a host to have an 
overview on who buzzed first, and to reset the buzzers remotely.

This is the source-code of [buzzer.moetz.dev](https://buzzer.moetz.dev).

## Setup

The docker image can be found here: [hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/kotlin-buzzer](https://hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/kotlin-buzzer).

Possible environment variables:

* `DOMAIN`: The domain this application is available at, e.g. `buzzer.example.org`
* `IS_SECURE`: Whether this application is available as HTTPS / behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (which it should be). Default to `true`.
* `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGS`: Whether the application (server-side) should output a bit more information, and also print the buzz log to stdout. Defaults to `false`.

### Data persistence

The server stores no state (or better: lobby-state is only stored in-memory), the only persistence that can be mapped out of the container is a log-file that contains all (buzzing / lobby related) events in a textfile:
* `/etc/log/kotlin-buzzer/log.txt`

### Example docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  buzzer:
    image: "flowmo7/kotlin-buzzer:master"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8080:8080 #Should be behind an SSL reverse proxy
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=buzzer.example.org
    volumes:
      - /srv/docker/buzzer/logs:/etc/log/kotlin-buzzer:rw
```
