This service provides a buzzing system with different lobbies with unlimited participants to join and a host to have an 
overview on who buzzed first, and to reset the buzzers remotely.

## Setup

The docker image can be found here: [hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/kotlin-buzzer](https://hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/kotlin-buzzer).

Possible environment variables:

* `DOMAIN`: The domain this application is available at, e.g. `buzzer.example.org`
* `SUB_PATH`: When this application is served on a sub-path (not directly on the given domain, by e.g. a reverse proxy), you need to set the path here. Defaults to _no path_.
* `IS_SECURE`: Whether this application is available as HTTPS / behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (which it should be). Default to `true`.
* `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGS`: Whether the application (server-side) should output a bit more information, and also print the buzz log to stdout. Defaults to `false`.
* `COLOR_FORM_BUTTON`: The color of the buttons before joining a lobby (on the index page). Defaults to `#161D99`.
* `COLOR_BUZZER_BUTTON_READY`: The color of the buzzer button. Defaults to `limegreen`.
* `COLOR_BUZZER_BUTTON_BUZZED`: The color of the buzzer button when already buzzed. Defaults to `cornflowerblue`.
* `DEFAULT_LOBBY_CODE_LENGTH`: The length of the generated (`[0-9a-f]`, lower-cased) lobby codes. Defaults to `6`.
* `DEFAULT_HOST_PASSWORD_LENGTH`: The length of the generated (`[0-9a-f]`, lower-cased) host passwords. Defaults to `8`.
